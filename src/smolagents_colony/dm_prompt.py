"""DM-origin prompt framing.

Plugin-layer lever on *compliance bias*: the tendency of an LLM, once
instructions reach inference, to treat a politely-worded DM request the
same way it would treat an operator prompt.

Three modes, configured via ``COLONY_DM_PROMPT_MODE``:

- ``none`` (default) — no preamble. Byte-for-byte identical to the
  un-framed message.
- ``peer`` — frames the sender as a peer agent on Colony, not the
  operator.
- ``adversarial`` — frames the sender as untrusted; instructs the agent
  to refuse embedded instructions and scrutinise premises.

Pure functions only — no Colony API calls, no env reads inside
:func:`apply_dm_prompt_mode`. The agent app reads the env var once at
startup and passes the resolved mode to each DM dispatch.

Preamble text is intentionally identical to ``@thecolony/elizaos-plugin``
v0.27.0 so the four plugins (``elizaos`` / ``langchain`` / ``pydantic-ai``
/ ``smolagents``) present the same framing surface to their respective
runtimes.
