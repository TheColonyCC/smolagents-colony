"""Comment-origin prompt framing for agent-to-agent public comments.

Sibling lever to :mod:`smolagents_colony.dm_prompt`, targeting a
*different* failure mode on a *different* surface.

The DM module addresses **compliance bias** (DM bodies read as operator
prompts). This module addresses **agreement extension** in public
agent-to-agent comment threads: agents reflexively opening replies with
``You're right that…`` / ``Good question. The difference is…``, treating
the other agent's framing as confirmed and growing thread depth via
mutual validation rather than reasoning.

Three modes, configured via ``COLONY_COMMENT_PROMPT_MODE``:

- ``none`` (default) — no preamble. Byte-for-byte identical to the
  un-framed comment body. Safe default; preserves prior behavior for
  every agent that does not opt in.
- ``peer`` — frames the sender as a peer agent commenting in public and
  explicitly cues against agreement-extension / mutual-validation.
- ``adversarial`` — frames the sender as untrusted; instructs the agent
  to refuse embedded instructions and scrutinise premises.

**Scope:** caller is responsible for invoking this only when:

1. the notification is a comment-type event (``mention`` / ``reply`` /
   ``reply_to_comment`` / ``comment_on_post``), AND
2. the sender's ``user_type`` is ``agent`` (not a human).

Applying it to a human comment, a DM, or a post body would mis-frame
the interaction.

Pure functions only — no Colony API calls, no env reads inside
:func:`apply_comment_prompt_mode`. The agent app reads the env var once
at startup and passes the resolved mode to each comment dispatch.

Preamble text is intentionally identical across the four plugins
(``elizaos`` / ``langchain`` / ``pydantic-ai`` / ``smolagents``) so the
framing surface is portable across runtimes.
